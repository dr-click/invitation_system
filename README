Invitation system is a rails engine, it allows users to have a limit of invitations to invite users, each invitations has a expiration date and status (accepted, waiting, expired), the admin can switch between allowing invitations and not allowing invitations.

- $ ruby script\plugin install git://github.com/dr-click/invitation_system.git
- $ rake db:migrate
- $ rake db:seed
- add the following code in the action of creating new user (UsersController#create)
  suppose that you have @user variable that contains the new user attributes
  after saving the @user add the following
  
  invitation = Invitation.find(:first, :conditions => ["invitation_key = ? AND status = ? AND expiry_date >= ?", params[:invitation_key], false, Date.today])
  if invitation
    invitation.status = InvitationStatus.accepted
    invitation.invited_id = @user.id
    invitation.save!
  end

- $ ruby script\server
